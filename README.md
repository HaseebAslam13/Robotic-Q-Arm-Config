## 🛠️ **Key Features**  
- **Object Pickup**: Automates object grabbing using pre-defined arm movements.  
- **Smart Drop-Off**: Uses potentiometers to identify zones for object placement.  
- **Dynamic Base Rotation**: Adjusts the arm's base based on real-time potentiometer feedback.  
- **Randomized Workflow**: Ensures all containers are used before program termination.
